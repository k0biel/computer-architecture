# Computer Architecture - Laboratories | Gdańsk University of Technology 2023/2024

This repository contains laboratory assignments for the "Computer Architecture" course, completed during the third semester. These tasks were completed in x86 32-bit assembly language, with some tasks integrating C.

## Lab 2: ASCII to UTF-16 Conversion with Emoji Replacement in Assembly

This task involved converting Polish ASCII characters to Unicode UTF-16 and replacing specific sequences (e.g., “gęś”) with emoji. It helped me learn about text encoding, memory manipulation, and character handling at a low level.

## Lab 3: Decimal Input and Precision Formatting in Assembly

This program takes a base-10 integer as input and displays it with a defined number of decimal places. It helped me develop skills in managing precision and formatting numbers at a low level.

## Lab 4: Fibonacci Sequence in Assembly and C

This task involved implementing a function to compute Fibonacci numbers using assembly integrated with C. It improved my skills in combining C for interaction and assembly for efficient iterative calculations.

## Lab 5: Time Dilation and Vector Maximum in Assembly and C

This lab consisted of two tasks. The first task calculated time dilation using assembly and C, demonstrating advanced floating-point operations in assembly with the use of the FPU (Floating Point Unit) for precision arithmetic.

The second task involved finding element-wise maximums of two arrays using SIMD instructions (SSE). This accelerated processing by handling multiple elements simultaneously, showcasing the efficiency of vectorized computations for data processing.

## Lab 6: Interrupt Handling and Real-Time Graphics in Assembly

This task involved using timer interrupts to animate stars ('*') on the screen and control their movement with arrow keys. The program was run in real mode on DOSBox. It helped me understand low-level graphics handling and real-time user input processing in assembly.
